Overview

 In this milestone, we must change the code to follow the use structures and unions. This will highlight our skills in writing in the C language and the ability to use structures and unions along with commented codes.


Initial Logic and Technical approach

The main goal of this project is to create a simple text-based calculator to perform simple calculations. However, this release has been most difficult because of the overview and asking myself if this code is completely different or do I need to incorporate it with my actual calculation? So, this release will show how the structure and unions were set up differently and show how the size of the union will be at 4 bytes and the size of the data structure integer will be at 12 bytes. 

Pseudocode

Start 
 type structure and union code
Show that union will have 4 bytes 
Show struct will have 12 bytes
END.

Risks

The most common mistakes made by new coders creating applications are human errors. This is the main topic split into many different sections. To start, new coders tend to make a lot of errors, and this could be through spelling mistakes or invalid code formats. Next, coders can become lazy and impact their productivity. This could be a noticeably big distraction and new coders may hate their team and members or be given a long deadline for a project and cram in all their work weeks before because of poor time management. Finally using online resources. Some of the online resources are not verified and if coders use codes online, they could be causing serious harm to their project and potentially their company security. Now as the projects get more complicated so do the risks, but the black box and white box testing methods would help with testing the software and application before release to help mitigate any doubt for risks. A black box test just means it is used to test software without any knowledge of the structure of the thing being tested. A white box is an approach the opposite, where the tester knows the internal structure. 

<New risk> Being overwhelemd and frustrasted I encountered making many mistakes and wanted to give up on the assignment.

Test Cases - Will be submitted seperately
 
 PLEASE READ - Since i was confused i have also submitted the other code spend most my time doing and mid confusion. This is to show how much work was put in and to get the max partial credit for the assignment.
